The **B2B Supplier** app allows you, as a supplier, to enable customers to sign up and log in as Buyer Organizations in your store. It enables components related to authentication and authorization of users and Buyer Organizations.

## Installation

To install the **B2B Supplier** app, you must follow the steps below.

1. Run the following command on your CLI:

    ```
    vtex install vtex.b2b-supplier
    ```


2. Add the app as a dependency in your theme‚Äôs `manifest.json` file, as follows:

    ```json
    "dependencies": {
    "vtex.b2b-supplier": "0.x"
    }
    ```


3. Declare the following blocks in a given theme template or inside another block from the theme.

| Block name | Description |
| ----------- |  ----------- | 
| `b2b-supplier.sign-up-button` | Renders a `Sign up` button that leads users to the form where they can sign up as a Buyer Organization. |
| `b2b-supplier.approved-status` | Renders an alert informing the Buyer Organization user of their approval status in your store. |

After the installation, it will be possible for buyers to Sign up as a Buyer Organization in your store or for you to create and manage Buyer Organizations via API.
